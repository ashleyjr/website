This was a great project I took part in with a group of six.
The task was to build a robot to compete in a game of football with other robots built to the specification by other teams.
We spent a lot of time in the lab building as everything had to fit on to a base provided.
         On top of the base we placed three layers of tri-pad board to house all the circuitry.
