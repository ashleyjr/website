Studied electronics at A-level. 
No maths all hackery. 
Fun but poor outcomes. 
I remember this picture because the scope in background is hooked up to an equaliser I made. 
I was using an MP3 player to input audio but kept busting the headphone socket. 
In retrospect I was probably drawing way to much current butStudied electronics at A-level.
