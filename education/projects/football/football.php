         This was a great project I took part in with a group of six.
         The task was to build a robot to compete in a game of football with other robots built to the specification by other teams.
         We spent a lot of time in the lab building as everything had to fit on to a base provided.
         On top of the base we placed three layers of tri-pad board to house all the circuitry.
         The football and playing field used different types colours of light as to provide information.
         The end product looked very cool but, like every other team, failed to play a game of football.
         The task was very hard but I learnt a lot about team/project management and electronics construction.
         Unfortunately the report remains lost.
