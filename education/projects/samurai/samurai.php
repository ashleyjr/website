   <h2>SAMURAI: Sixteen bit Arm and Mips Unified Risc Architecture with Interrupts</h2>
	  <img src="samurai.jpg" alt="samurai" target="_blank"><br>

	Samurai is a novel microprocessor unit in full custom 0.35um CMOS.<br>
	All cells were created by myself along with three team members<br>
	The reaming work was done by myself and two of the original members with a fourth external member. <br>
	<br>
	The processor was the only one produced, out of the ten teams made from that year of students, to implement interrupts.<br>
	Only one is fabricated each year and we came in second place to a team with a much smaller design (our 4.61 sq mm against their 2.79 sq mm).<br>
	They also implemented a multiply instruction whereas we chose to invest our efforts in a multi-bit shifter and interrupts.<br>
	Our design is ready for fabrication but unfortunately will remain just a design.<br>
	A large shot of the floor plan lives on my bedroom wall. <br>
	Myself and my team mates are very proud.<br>
	<br>
	We have a verified our custom instruction set and in the code you will also find an assembler.<br>
	Maybe one day I'll port a C complier for our chip and save up to send it off for fabrication.<br>
	Who knows, maybe on day home fabs will be just as common as 3D printers?<br>
