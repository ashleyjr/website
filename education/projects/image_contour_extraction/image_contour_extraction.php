   <h2>Image contour extraction</h2>
      <img src="tongue.jpg" alt="Tongue" target="_blank"><img src="mountains.jpg" alt="Mountains" target="_blank">  
      <p>
         This was a piece of coursework submitted for an module called 'Intelligent Algorithms'.
         A significant milestone for any of my software work.
         My biggest project in <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/" target="_blank">MATLAB</a> and the first time I had really coded intelligently.
         The task was to extract the contour of a tongue from an x-ray.
         This involved setting a search space grid and computing energy expenditure when moving from one side to the other.
