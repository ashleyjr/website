Began work on a UART GUI for entry level electronics hobbyists/student. The idea being to make debugging microcontroller projects a lot easy by developing a helpful user interface. This was inspired by using USB to UART cables a lot during my degree but constantly having deal with a terminal interface or viewing waveforms. Which was helpful but the whole process could be improved by having a general GUI to assist with data interpretations.
