      Please visit <a href="http://www.csr.com/" target="_blank">www.csr.com</a> to find information on the company.

      <p>
      Connected to the company via the <a href="../education/ukesf.php" target="content">UKESF</a> scholarship. 
      I worked with the digital design department mainly reviewing pieces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language" target="_blank">HDL</a> and trying to wrap my head around what was going on.
      I throughly enjoyed my time here and the chance to work with some really clever people.
      I'm back this summer.
      </p>

      <h3>First Summer: 07/2012 - 09/2012</h3>
      Spent my time running time based power simulation on some designs.
      <h3>Second Summer: 07/2013 - 09/2013</h3>
      Started off on some small projects which included verification of some mixed signal designs and the development of my own design for deployment in some in house testing hardware.  
      Then I moved on to protocol testing of an RF design.
