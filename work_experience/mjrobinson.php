      <h2>M.J.Robinson Garden Maintenance</h2>
      
      My father runs a garden maintenance business based in the town of Alton, Hampshire.
      He has no online presence and doesn't even advertise he mainly gets work from recommendation by friends and family.
      Here's a yellow pages website that contains details on how to get in touch with him 
      <a href="http://www.yell.com/biz/m-j-robinson-garden-maintenance-alton-2266018/" target="_blank">http://www.yell.com/biz/m-j-robinson-garden-maintenance-alton-2266018/</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I started working with him from the age of thirteen. 
      This included various tasks such as grass cutting, collecting hedge clippings and gathering equipment.
      I still work for him occasionally, the job is physically demanding but very enjoyable (when sunny), it's a great chance to spend time outside.
