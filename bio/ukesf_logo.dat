I have been involved in the UKESF scheme since the second semester of my second year of university. Partnered with CSR I spent my summers working in their digital design department. Apart from the generous bursary provided the scholarship gave me a great chance to work on skills which prospective employers seek. A workshop is mandatory which brings together scholars to share their experiences and hone skills that promote teamwork. It was also a great opportunity to meet students from all over the UK who share the same interests in engineering as myself.
