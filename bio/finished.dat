This was a great project I took part in with a group of six.
The task was to build a robot to compete in a game of football with other robots built to the specification by other teams.
 The end product looked very cool but, like every other team, failed to play a game of football.
The task was very hard but I learnt a lot about team/project management and electronics construction.
