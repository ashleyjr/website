   <h2>Bio in words</h2>
      <p>
      I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawton" target="_blank">Chawton</a>; a small village on the edge of the South Downs.
      Its claim to fame being the home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" target="_blank">Jane Austen</a> for a while.     
      I attended the local primary school progressing to the Secondary school in the nearby town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton,_Hampshire" target="_blank">Alton</a>. 
      Strengths in Mathematics and Science led to me enrolling in Computing, Electronics, Maths and Physics A level courses at the local sixth form college.
      A peaking interest in the field of electronics brought me to the University of Southampton where I am now studying for an MEng in Electronic Engineering with Artificial Intelligence.

      <p>
      These days I am either wearing a suit or looking like a tramp.
      I used to look a bit different.
      Digital cameras became popular in my late teens so I will start from then. 
      </p>
      <img src="matts_house.jpg" alt="Matts house" target="_blank"> 
      <p>
      Approximately 17. Use to do a lot of drinking with secondary school mates. 
      Still do when we're together. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Brought a Land Rover when I passed my driving test. 
      Awesome but cost me a lot of money.
      </p>
      <img src="electronics_start.jpg" alt="Starting out in electronics" target="_blank">
      <p>
      Studied electronics at A-level. 
      No maths all hackery. 
      Fun but poor outcomes. 
      I remember this picture because the scope in background is hooked up to an equaliser I made. 
      I was using an MP3 player to input audio but kept busting the headphone socket. 
      In retrospect I was probably drawing way to much current but the hard way is still a way to learn.

      <p>
      Backpacking is great. 
      The outdoors is underrated. 
      Should have some pictures of me hunting with dad but we don't care for carrying cameras.
      </p>

      <p>
      Mum and dad have always been awesome and still are. 
      I'm 21 now and a fair bit taller than them.
